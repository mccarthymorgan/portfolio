Public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

# About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Morgan McCarthy and I use she/her pronouns. I am a second-year student at Carnegie Mellon in the Master of Science in Public Policy Management and Data Analytics program. Before coming to Pittsburgh, I graduated from Ohio University where I studied Business Analytics in the Honors Tutorial College. I chose to attend graduate school to expand my analytical skills while learning how to apply them in the public policy context. 

# What I Hope to Learn

I am taking this course so I can learn more about creating better data visualizations. In the past, courses I have taken have covered basic chart types (like scatter plots or pie charts) or how to code a type of data visualization in a specific language. However, I am really interested in learning the foundations of data visualization so I can apply it regardless of the context. After graduation, I will be working as a consultant for State and Local Governments. I hope to apply what I learn in the class to make visualizations that more effectively communicate to clients. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words!
