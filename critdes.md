# Finding a Graph

For my Critique by Design Assignment I redesigned the graph titled "Productivity Puzzle" in the Wall Street Journal article ["Is a Four-Day Week the Future of Work?"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-a-four-day-week-the-future-of-work-11627704011). I selected this graph because I thought the information contained in the graph was extremely interesting, but did not support the article as well as it could have. I also wanted to try to improve a graph that was relatively well done, since we had criquited obviously flawed graphs before. 

The data from the graph comes from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It utilizes two measurements, the [Average Annual Hours Worked](https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm) and the [GDP Per Hour Worked](https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm)

# Critiquing the Visualization

The article asks if companies in the United States could support a four day work week, and compares it to other countries. However, the visualization does not indicate how many hours per year a four- or five-day work week is each year, which makes it difficult to relate the graph to the contents of the article. I also think the graph is quite busy and cramped, without a visual difference to make the United States stand out from the countries that are not discussed in the article. Additionally, the title, while snappy, does not help readers to easily interpret the graph. After a significant amount of time looking at the graph, I realized the United States was one of the only countries that increased the number of annual hours worked from 2009 to 2019, which I think is lost in the business of the graph. I also wanted to try to flip the x- and y-axis to see if that improved reader understanding. We typically think of the y-axis as the dependent variable; since the title of the graph is arguing that productivity is not dependent on hours worked, the productivity should be on the y-axis. 

# Wireframing the Solution
