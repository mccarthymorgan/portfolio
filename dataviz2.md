Our second assignment utilized a dataset from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). [This dataset](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) contains OCED countries and their Debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2020. This ratio shows the country's total debt as a percentage of their Gross Domestic Product.

# Working with Flourish, Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Over Past 10 Years Compared to United States

The three visualizations above vary in how they present the information contained in the dataset. The first visualization, the Government Debt Bar Chart, shows the Debt-to-GDP ratio for each country in 2018 from lowest to highest ratio. This bar chart shows each country's ratio at a specific time and compares the percentages to other countries and the OCED average. The second visualization is a Grid of Line Charts. Each country has a separate line chart that tracks the Debt-to-GDP ratio over time. The line chart of each country can then be compared to other line charts. Finally, I made a slope chart for the visualization of my choice. It shows how the countries ratios have changed over the past ten years. Like the grid of line charts, it shows changes over time. However, they are all contained on the same graph, and not split apart. 

I made the chart to show the past 10 years to compare how the worldwide debts had changed since the recession in the United States. I think especially after the 2008 recession, Americans are very cognizant of their national debt. I wanted to be able to compare how it had changed over the past 10 years in comparison to other countries.  I learned that while many counties, and the OCED average, had increased. It did not appear to be by much. I was surprised to learn that the debt gone down in as many cases as it had.

 I elected to highlight the United States to make it easier to compare to other countries. I also highlighted the OCED average to compare to the US and other countries. I developed two categories, one where the Debt-to-GDP ratio had increased from 2009 to 2019, and another one for countries where the ratio had decreased. I used dark pink and dark green to represent these categories, since many people associate red with worse finances (like increasing debt) and green with better finances (like decreasing debt). The color combo was selected from [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=PiYG&n=11) which indicated the palette as color-blind safe.
