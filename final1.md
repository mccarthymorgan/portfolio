# Outline

In 2020, Pittsburgh [reported it's lowest lead level in decades](https://www.pgh2o.com/about-us/performance/year-review-2020/lowest-lead-levels-decades) and committed to replacing existing lead service lines by 2026. For my project, I want to explain the history of lead in Pittsburgh's water lines, the problems with lead in drinking water, where they are making repairs, and what individuals living in Pittsburgh can do personally and systemically to decrease lead in water lines.

The story will be structured as follows:

- Problems with Lead in Drinking Water, which will establish why it is important to not have any lead whatsoever in drinking water.
- Pittsburgh's history with lead in drinking water and how it has changed over the years. This will give context to the problem and show the progress of the city relative to its past.
- Most affected neighborhoods and the demographics of those neighborhoods. I want to explore the income level, race, and rental mix of these most affected neighborhoods. This will allow for discussion about if the existing solutions are adequate. The purpose for this is two-fold, Pittsburgh has emphasized [water equity](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2021/04/23/pwsa-lead-pipes-and-water-equity/) in their plans prioritizing which pipes to replace first so I want to see if their plans have been effective related to race and income. Also, their [current solutions](https://lead.pgh2o.com/resources/request-a-lead-test-kit/) (in my opinion) are prohibative to renters. For example, both of my Pittsburgh landlords have paid the water bill so I do not have an account number to request a test kit. A positive test kit is the only way to get a free lead filter. Examining rental rates in affected areas might help to show gaps in their current plans. 
- Solutions for individuals and caveats (such as testing own water, running tap for 1 mintue).
- Systemic solutions to improve health in Pittsburgh (water filters, improving home testing kits for renters).

# Data

My story requires historical data on lead rates in Pittsburgh. This will be pulled from two sources.

First, data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, in the dataset [Allegheny County Elevated Blood Lead Level Rates](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-elevated-blood-lead-level-rates). This will show present day lead levels in specific neighborhoods.

Second, [data on lead rates in the past 20 years](https://lead.pgh2o.com/resources/customer-water-quality-data/) from the Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority. This will show the lead levels of specific areas over the past 20 years. 

Also, I will pull census data on rental-occupied housing, income, and race from the [Pittsburgh SNAP Census Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh) 
                         
# Method and Medium    

I plan to use Shorthand to make my final project both able to stand alone and interactive. Shorthand uses a method they call [Scrollytelling](https://shorthand.com/features/scrollytelling/) where scrolling down reveals additional parts of each story. This will allow me to reveal different parts of my story as the reader scrolls down. Any context setting for my story will occur within Shorthand. I do not intend to use any additional storytelling methods (like Powerpoint, mixed media, etc) to present my story.
