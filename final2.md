[Final Project, Part 1](https://mccarthymorgan.github.io/portfolio/final1.html)
                         
# Storyboard and Wireframe 

My project storyboard, broken into proposed sections is below. The wireframed visualizations are included in each proposed section. 

## Timeline of Lead in Pittsburgh

[Main Source for Key Timeline Events](https://www.publicsource.org/timeline-the-evolution-of-lead-contamination-in-pittsburghs-water/)

Proposed Visual:



The reader would scroll from left to right on the timeline and the following would pop up as they continued scolling with a dot on the line graph to indicte the lead level at each key event below:

  In 2014, Pittsburgh switches from soda ash to caustic soda in lead lines without notifying the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. 
  In 2016, Pittsburgh is ordered to begin testing due to their use of caustic soda. The lead limit is above the federal threshold of 15 ppb. 
  In 2017, Pittsburgh mayor commits to $1M in lead filters for Pittsburgh residents. 
  In 2020, Pittsburgh [reported it's lowest lead level in decades](https://www.pgh2o.com/about-us/performance/year-review-2020/lowest-lead-levels-decades), and fell below the federal level for action.

## Hazards of Lead

[Main Source for Lead Problems](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/lead/final/monographhealtheffectslowlevellead_newissn_508.pdf)

Proposed Visual: 



Any level of lead in waterlines is bad for heatlh, espically in small doses over a long period of time. The current federal maximum lead level of 15ppb was established in the 1980s based on feedback from utility companies about what they could realistically accomplish. The maximum lead level is not based on public health findings. ANY amount of lead in water is bad for health. Pittsburgh being below the threshhold, does not indicate better public health. Pittsburgh should shoot for 0ppb, not less than 15ppb.

## Current Efforts and Neighborhood Deep Dive

Pittsburgh has [committed to replacing existing public lead service lines by 2026](https://www.pgh2o.com/about-us/performance/year-review-2020/lowest-lead-levels-decades). And has committed $1.0 Million to lead filters for homes who have tested 

Pittsburgh's [current solutions](https://lead.pgh2o.com/resources/request-a-lead-test-kit/) are prohibative to renters. 

Proposed Visualization: 



A bar graph showing the five most affected areas that would allow users to click through the following buttons: Percent of Children Affected, Average Income, Rental Mix. Each graph is presented seperately here, but in the visualization they could click to change the graph to allow for ease of comparison. 

## What to Do About It

Individually, if residents pay for their own water bill they can request a lead test kit. If that test kit is found to have lead, then the city will send them a free water filter. However, if they rent and do not pay their own water bill they can buy their own filter. Experts recommend only using cold water to cook and running the tap with cold water for at least one minute 

Systemically, the City of Pittsburgh needs to improve their outreach program. There should be an alternative form to allow people who rent to request testing kit. There could be additional ways to prove residency, like a lease. Also, since Pittsburgh sends out the water kits via mail, the form could verify the address with city records. 

# User Research

To determine if my story and data visualizations were compelling, I conducted user reasearch on my storyboard and wireframe. 

## Target Audience

My target audience for my story is residents of Pittsburgh, PA who are engaged and invested in the city, they care about the city's future and about equitable treatment of the city's residents and the city's infrastructure plans. My target audience may not know about the city's history of lead in the waterlines, or they may know about the city's history of lead in the waterlines but do not know what the city's plans to address it may be. 

While not part of my target audience, I do think my story would more broadly appeal to people who are connected to the region but do not live there, or people who live in cities like Pittsburgh who are addressing failing infrastructure problems. 

## Identifying Individuals to Interview

My approach to identifying individuals to interview was to capture perspectives both inside and outside of Pittsburgh, while still maintaining connection to the region. I felt that public policy students at Heinz, while extremely engaged and invested in the city, might know more than the average CMU student when it came to infrastructure issues in the city. Additionally, I wanted to select people who were media and technology literate, but not necessarily data visualization experts to verify that my visuals were easily understandable. That eliminated many of my peers at Heinz.

### First Interviewee
For that reason, I elected to interview one CMU student in his mid-20s, who has lived here for three years but is not aware of the local government's approach to fixing lead in the waterlines. He will continue to live here for at least another two years, so he is invested in the region and its infrastructure. 

### Second Interviewee
I also wanted a perspective from a younger person in her early 20s who was considering moving to Pittsburgh within two years, so they had a connection to the region. Feedback I received from my peers in class indicated that a good audience for my story would be young people moving to the region who were unaware of lead problems. Her feedback is intended to capture this group. 

### Third Interviewee
Finally, I sought feedback from a woman in her 50s who has family living in the region but does not have plans to ever live in Pittsburgh. Her perspective is important because it will allow me to see if the visualization can appeal to readers beyond my target audience. Additionally, in comparison to my previous two interviewees she has more right-leaning political views, so she may not support some of my more costly suggestions. 

## Interview Script

Do you feel concerned about the presence of lead in Pittsburgh water lines? How has your perspective change?

What do you still wish you knew about lead in Pittsburgh water lines? 

Did you think the story flowed nicely? (Pun intended)

Do you think the currrent efforts by Pittsburgh are sufficent to address lead in the water lines? Could they be doing more? Should they be doing less?

What do you think someone in Pittsburgh would want to do after reading this story? (Call to Action)

## Findings

### Man, Mid 20's, Pittsburgh Resident, CMU Student, Not Politically Active, Lives in Rental Housing

He previously did not know about the problems with lead in Pittsburgh's water line and was suprised to learn how bad it was. He looked up the map from PWSA and found his house still had a public lead line. He also said his landlord pays for his water, so he does not know how he would recieve a lead testing kit or a filter for his water, which was frustrating to him. He does currently have a water filter but does not know if it removes lead (I explained that standard brita filters did not remove lead). He thinks Pittsburgh is doing a decent job replacing lead lines, but did not think Pittsburgh would be replacing them without pressure from the state and the federal government. He wanted my timeline to be longer than 2020, to see if the lead levels were contiuing to drop over time or if they had stalled. He thought the story flowed somewhat nicely. He was not particularly interested in which neighborhoods were most affected, since the city committed to replacing all public lines by 2026.

### Woman, Early 20's, Potential Future Pittsburgh Resident, Liberal, Lives in Rental Housing

She said that the lead in Pittsburgh's waterline would not prohibit her from moving here, but it would make her want to check the PWSA map to verify that where she lived was not in an area with lead. As a nursing student, she is extremely concerned about long term lead exposure. She really liked the idea of the visualization contrasting the federal maxium with the health problems below it. She did not really care about the different neighborhoods, and said that would not impact her decision on where to live. Instead, she said she would want to pay for her own water so she could get a testing kit and proper filter. She asked how many renters paid for their own water, and I did not have a solid number. She wanted to know the percent before she could judge Pittsburgh's efforts.

### Woman, Mid 50's, Family in Pittsburgh, Conservative, Owns House

She had not previously heard about Pittsburgh's lead problems and was shocked that the city had gone against the state's recommendations. She pulled up the PWSA map and checked where all of her loved ones lived, although many lived outside of their service area. She wondered how the other water service areas in the area were affected. She also wanted to check on lead levels in her area after our interview. Additionally, she did not get any value out of the neighborhood deep dive, and only had heard of one of the neighborhoods. She wanted more information about the city's budget. Had the original $1M for filters been spent? Where was the money coming from? How much would it cost to give every household a filter? Did every household need a filter? These were great questions that I had not previously considered.

## Planned Changes

Based on my user research, I need to incorporate the PWSA map in my final story or at least a link to it. Every person who I interviewed asked me to email them the link to the map, and immediately looked up where they lived. I think I was so focused on the story as a whole, I neglected to realize most people would want to know how it would affect them personally, or their loved ones. 

I also was suprised that all interviewees found the different neighborhood visualization to be unimportant to the main story. Going forward, I will need to consider if I want to leave that section in or remove it entirely. Based on feedback from the second and third interviewee, I could replace the neighborhood deep dive with more city-wide financial data. How much has Pittsburgh spent to date on the lead testing kits and filters, what it would cost to provide each household a filter, where would the money come from?

Overall, I found the feedback helpful and I intend to reach back out when my wireframes become full visualizations to get the interviewees feedback on what else they would like to see, and if they still found it compelling. I think it will be espically important for me to get feedback on the budget section, since I had not previously considered the
