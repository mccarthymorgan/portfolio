# Storyboard and Wireframe 

My project storyboard, broken into proposed sections is below. The wireframed visualizations are included in each proposed section. 

## Introduction to Lead in Pittsburgh

## Current Efforts

## Affected Neighborhoods

## How to Improve



# User Research

To determine if my story and data visualizations were compelling, I conducted user reasearch on my storyboard and wireframe. 

## Target Audience

My target audience for my story is residents of Pittsburgh, PA who are engaged and invested in the city, they care about the city's future and about equitable treatment of the city's residents and the city's infrastructure plans. My target audience may not know about the city's history of lead in the waterlines, or they may know about the city's history of lead in the waterlines but do not know what the city's plans to address it may be. 

While not part of my target audience, I do think my story would more broadly appeal to people who are connected to the region but do not live there, or people who live in cities like Pittsburgh who are addressing failing infrastructure problems. 

## Identifying Individuals to Interview

My approach to identifying individuals to interview was to capture perspectives both inside and outside of Pittsburgh, while still maintaining connection to the region. I felt that public policy students at Heinz, while extremely engaged and invested in the city, might know more than the average CMU student when it came to infrastructure issues in the city. Additionally, I wanted to select people who were media and technology literate, but not necessarily data visualization experts to verify that my visuals were easily understandable. That eliminated many of my peers at Heinz.


## First Interviewee
For that reason, I elected to interview one CMU student in his mid-20s, who has lived here for three years but is not aware of the local government's approach to fixing lead in the waterlines. He will continue to live here for at least another two years, so he is invested in the region and its infrastructure. 

## Second Interviewee
I also wanted a perspective from a younger person in her early 20s who was considering moving to Pittsburgh within two years, so they had a connection to the region. Feedback I received from my peers in class indicated that a good audience for my story would be young people moving to the region who were unaware of lead problems. Her feedback is intended to capture this group. 

## Third Interviewee
Finally, I sought feedback from a woman in her 50s who has family living in the region but does not have plans to ever live in Pittsburgh. Her perspective is important because it will allow me to see if the visualization can appeal to readers beyond my target audience. Additionally, in comparison to my previous two interviewees she has more right-leaning political views, so she may not support some of my more costly suggestions.
