# [Final Story: Lead Levels in Pittsburgh's Water](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/lead-levels-in-pittsburgh-s-water/index.html)


# Changes Made Since Part 2
One of the main changes I made since Part 2 was to remove discussion of individual neighborhoods and instead focus on Pittsburgh's renters as a whole. I believe this made my story stronger since it kept the story more focused on Pittsburgh as a whole, which allowed it to appeal more to my broader audience. Of the people I interviewed, all found the link to the invidiual map to be the most compelling, since it allowed them to check if they were affected. Since I was trying to appeal to as many people in Pittsburgh as possible, I did not want to detract from the broad implications of lead poisioning by focusing on specific neighborhoods. 

I also added a graphic to the health implications section. I did not believe that the adverse health effects would be taken as seriously without concrete numbers explaining how many children were impacted. I originally intended to track the percent of childrent with lead exposure over time, but Allegheny County did not require lead testing for all children age 9-12mos before 2018. The data source notes indicated that the pre-2018 numbers should be interpreted with caution, since the children who recieved lead testing might be checking specifically for lead poisioing. Additionally, in 2020 Allegheny County changed the way they defined high lead levels in children. Prior to 2020, blood lead levels greater than 10 ppb were reported. In 2020, blood lead levels greater than 5 ppb were reported. Since the percentatges were not measuring the same number, I did not want to mislead readers. The 2019 number was close to 2% while the 2020 number was close to 6% of children. This line chart would have shown an increase from 2019 to 2020 in the percent of children with elevated lead levels. Since the dataset did not report the percent of children in 2020 with blood levels above 10 ppb, I could not compare the two numbers. 

I did explore the budget allocation to Pittsburgh's lead response, as one of my interviewees suggested in Part 2. However, I could only find information that included the replacement of the pipes, making the number significantly higher than the amount actually dedicated to resident testing kits. Since I did not discuss the specific details of the lead pipe replacement program (public/private side, PWSA's low interest loans and rate increases, etc) I decided incorporated their finiancial questions by talking about how much a testing kit would cost. I think this may have been more effective since my target audience was individuals. In my opinion, making the argument for a higher budget allocation is much more difficult than explaining the amount that a residents without a PSWA account would have to pay to get a test kit.

I also wanted to make a graphic with the number of lead test kits requested each year. I was able to find the information for 2021 in a [PWSA press release](https://www.pgh2o.com/news-events/news/press-release/2022-01-20-pwsa-maintains-low-lead-levels-drinking-water), and I thought it could be interesting to show the reach of the program and how it had evolved over the past five years. However, I could not find any other press releases with the number of testing kits and filters provided. Additionally, the current methods of requesting a lead kit were implemented quite recently. In 2017, the City of Pittsburgh was giving out [filters for free](https://pittsburghpa.gov/safepgh2o/) without a lead testing kit required.
